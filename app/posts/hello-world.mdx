Welcome to my very first blog post. I'm excited to share my thoughts and experiences with you using this new blog platform built with Next.js and MDX.

## What to Expect

In this blog, I'll be writing about:

1. Web development
2. New technologies
3. Personal projects
4. Coding tips and tricks

## Why I Started This Blog

I **decided** to start _this_ blog to:

- Share my knowledge with others
- Document my learning journey
- Connect with like-minded developers

## A Bit of Code

Since this is a tech blog, here's a obligatory "Hello World" in JavaScript:

```javascript
console.log('Hello, World!');
```

## A Table

| Name  | Age | Location |
| ----- | --- | -------- |
| Alice | 25  | USA      |
| Bob   | 30  | Canada   |
| Carol | 22  | UK       |

## Autolink literals

www.example.com, https://example.com, and contact@example.com.

## Footnote

A note[^1]

[^1]: Big note.

## Strikethrough

~one~ or ~~two~~ tildes.

## Table

| a   | b   |   c |  d  |
| --- | :-- | --: | :-: |

## Tasklist

- [ ] to do
- [x] done

That's it for my first blog post. I hope you enjoyed it. Stay tuned for more exciting content coming soon!
